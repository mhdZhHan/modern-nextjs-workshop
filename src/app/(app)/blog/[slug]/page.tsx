  title: "Understanding the Basics of React Hooks",
  content: `
    <p>React Hooks have revolutionized the way we write React components. They allow us to use state and other React features without writing a class. This makes our code more readable and easier to understand.</p>
    <h2>What are Hooks?</h2>
    <p>Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They don't work inside classes â€” they let you use React without classes.</p>
    <h2>Why Hooks?</h2>
    <p>Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected problems in React that we've encountered over five years of writing and maintaining tens of thousands of components. Whether you're learning React, use it daily, or even prefer a different library with a similar component model, you might recognize some of these problems.</p>
